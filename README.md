# 99 `<programming language here>` Problems

First there were [99 Prolog Problems](http://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2009s2/prolog/problemas/)  
Then there were [99 Lisp Problems](https://www.ic.unicamp.br/~meidanis/courses/mc336/2006s2/funcional/L-99_Ninety-Nine_Lisp_Problems.html)  
Then there were [99 Haskell Problems](https://wiki.haskell.org/H-99:_Ninety-Nine_Haskell_Problems)  

Now I want to do these problems in various programming languages just for fun.

I'm starting with a relatively new programming language called Coconut,
which brings some of the nice features of modern functional programming 
languages to Python.
